# Game-Hub
Welcome to the game hub!
We use this to bring games and integrate (Tornous Games)[https://tornous-github.io] into the normal tornous website!
As we have no to little experince to developing web apps we decided to keep it as simple as possible, we suggest going to (the Tornous Games website)[https://tornous-games.github.io] to play the more advanced games.
We keep this open source to help other people learn to make this kind of stuff! (Credit must be given.)
