# Contributing
Contributing to this is very helpful but if it's going to make our code worse and/or non-family friendly then it will automatically be denied
## Issues
Contributing by issues is a great way to get to us and fix some content without you needing to know how to code!
### When to
When to make an issue is up to you! Although we recommed for you to make an issue when there needs to be a `file update, feature added, or a bug fix` we will still awnser your questions on an issue... we would want you to ask a question in the `Discussions` section though...
## Pull Requests
Only do this when you know what you are doing because you are ***CHANGING THE CODE!!!!*** and if you are put your name and/or username in the `CONTRIBUTORS` file (this is not required) and make sure you enter your changes in the `CHANGELOG.md` file or it will be declined
