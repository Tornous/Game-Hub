## Open AI (Name Pick)
**Game Hub**

    I chose "Game Hub" because it aptly reflects the creator's dual interest in coding and playing games. The term "Hub" suggests a central place or platform, indicating a gathering point for both coding enthusiasts and gamers. This name not only highlights the user's passion but also conveys a sense of community and collaboration in the world of coding and gaming.
